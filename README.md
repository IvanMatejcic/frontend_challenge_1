## This is an attempt at my first frontend challenge.  
The challenge is creating a landing page with working links, responsiveness,a hovering animation and working navigation (desktop & mobile).  

🎯 Target : User can see the similar design ✅  
🎯 Target : Responsive design ✅  
🎯 Target : On mobile, when I select the hamburger menu, I can see a navigation ✅  

CSS is used for styling the page, JavaScript for the mobile navigation.
